## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kirill

I am an applied computer science student who in his free time tries to work with different modern technologies and creates small open-source projects. Currently, I am interested in TypeScript (React, NextJS, Remix) and Rust, prior to my admission to the university I've already been actively writing in Python with asyncio, besides that at the university I've started using Java and Kotlin. I also like to use PostgreSQL and Redis in my projects.

I greatly appreciate open-source community and admire the developers who are constantly contributing to the open-source development. Lately I have been excited to work with Linux and its ecosystem, currently using Arch Linux on my devices.


#### Here's some projects that I've created

 - [University timetable](https://github.com/httport/uni-timetable-bot) Telegram bot written in Rust
 - [zaychik](https://github.com/httport/zaychik) general purpose Discord bot originally wirtten in Rust, and now rewritten in Kotlin
 - [Tomodachi](https://github.com/httport/tomodachi) moderation Discord bot written in Python 
 - - [Tomodachi REST](https://github.com/httport/tomodachi-rest) is a small backend written in Python FastAPI for the Tomodachi Discord bot
 - [Twitch Chat Reader](https://github.com/httpolar/TwitchChatReader) for Minecraft, a mod written with Java and Fabric API
